# Conway's Game of Life
A C++ project to create the zero-player game Conway's Game of Life, the rules for each tile are simple but combined create complex interactions.

 As well as the basic simulation, my program can also automatically run games at high speeds using multi-threading, searching for specific shapes within the patterns of these games, such as blinkers, gliders and light-weight space ships.
